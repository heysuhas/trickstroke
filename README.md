## 🎮 How to Play

### 1. **Join a Lobby**
   - Up to **8 players** can join a game
   - One player becomes the **Host** who controls game settings

### 2. **Roles**
   - **🎨 Artists**: Receive a **Secret Word** and must create words related to it
   - **🎭 Trickster**: Does **NOT** see the word. Their goal is to blend in and avoid detection

### 3. **The Game**
   - Players take turns submitting **one word** related to the Secret Word
   - **Trickster Twist**: If the Trickster goes first, they get a list of options to help them bluff
   - **No Repeats**: You cannot use the Secret Word or any word already submitted

### 4. **Discussion & Voting**
   - After everyone submits, discuss and vote on who you think the Trickster is
   - Use the chat to strategize and accuse

### 5. **Winning**
   - **🎨 Artists Win**: If they successfully vote out the Trickster
   - **🎭 Trickster Wins**: If they survive the vote (or if the vote is a tie after Max Rounds)
